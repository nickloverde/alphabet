// Welcome.

// In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

// If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

// "a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

// Whiteboard:
// First, I want to split each character in the String
// Then, I want to create a switch statement with all the letters corresponding to their alphabet position
// Then, I want to join them all again as one long String
